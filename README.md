# CodeClubScratchModuleA
These files are Scratch .SB3 files, that I produced using Scratch (version 3),  based on the Raspberry Pi Code Club (CC) Module Projects. I have also used: 20 Games To Create With Scratch by Max Wainewright (QED Publishing 2016).

# How to load a SB3 Scratch file into a Scratch WebPage (version 3) (Windows 10.1)

First, you must have a copy of the sb3 file on your computer. You can download a SB3 file from my GitHub site as follows:

1. Select the SB3 file in my GitHub site
2. Click on the Download button
3. Select Show in Folder option and the SB3 file should be in the Downloads folder

The scratch procedure is:
1. Internet Browser
2. http://scratch.mit.edu/
3. Create
4. Close Tutorial
5. Sign In
6. File name box is:   Untitled
7. File menu/tab/toolBar and Load from your computer
8. Navigate to your sb3 file and Open
9. scratch.mit.edu says: Replace contents of the current project
10. NB Your current project should be a base/empty Scratch project and unimportant. So click on OK to upload your SB3 file. If your current project is not a base/empty Scratch project and is important then click on Cancel and ensure that the current project has been saved in Scratch and try again, selecting OK this time.
11. File name box is:    has name of your file          This indicates that the SB3 Scratch file has been uploaded.

To see the Scratch code or costumes or sounds, click on each sprite icon below the stage (Bottom, Right), and select the appropriate tab (Top, Left). You can do similarly for the Backdrops; start by clicking Stage button on the Bottom, Right.

To run or use these scratch SB3 files either: (a) click on each sprite character on the stage (Top, Right) in turn or (b) click on the green flag to start.

The red hex when clicked stops the running of the project.

For Scratch .SB3 files that have audio, remember to enable audio on your computer so that you can hear the sounds from the stage.

1. DRUMversion2.sb3  (audio)  (click on space key on the keyboad) (click on each character on the stage).
2. myModule1RockBand.sb3 (audio) (click on space key on the keyboad) (click the green flag).
3. myModule1GhostBusters.sb3 (audio) (click the geen flag) (click on each character on the stage).
4. myModule1Chatbot.sb3  (click on the character on the stage).
5. myModule1PaintBox.sb3 (click the green flag) (click on each character on the stage). (Note: eraser works better with very a large width (eg 40, 80 etc) and writing works better with low widths (eg 3, 10 etc)
6. myModule1PaintBoxRemix.sb3  (same as  myModule1PaintBox.sb3) (keyboard key b=blue)
7. myModule1PaintBox_PickColour.sb3  (click the green flag) (click on each character on the stage). (keyboard keys e = erase all o = orange y=yellow g=green r=red space=black w=white) (Investigate pick_a_colour i.e. when you want the colour in the code to be exactly the same as a colour of an item on the stage. Note sometimes in the Scratch code you want to use an if-else construct to choose if two colours are the same or not the same and execute different code for these two circumstances. Try to change the white in the exising code to the red of the red square on the stage. Click on the white colour in the code to get a colour palett and click on the colour-picker at the bottom of the pallett. The screen dimms. Move the colour-picker icon carefully to the stage and align the colour-picker icon on the red square in the stage and click. Note, the need of the pick_a_colour arises because, using the above example, the red on the pallete may be slightly different to the red of the square on the stage.
8. myModule1BoatRaceRemix.sb3 (click the green flag) (audio).


# SB3 Files
1. Module2MemoryAA.sb3 (audio) Click the green flag and the dancer (sprite) on the stage starts to dance with a white dress and ends with a pink dress. Memorise the colour sequence of the dresses between the white & pink dresses. When the dancer reaches the pink dress, click the drums each in turn, on the stage in the same colour sequence that you memorised for the dancer. If you are successful, the dancer repeates the dance routine, but with one more dress. This continues, one more dress each time, until you click the red hex button to stop the project.

Click on Green flag to start and red hex button to stop.

Increased or Decrease the Horizontal or Vertical Speed of the fish sprite character.
On the keyboard, click on the h key or the v key to identify horizontal speed or vertical speed of the fish sprite character.

Then click on p key or m key to select if plus or minus  (increase or decrease)  of the already selected speed. If you mis-type
the p key or m key then just re-type the correct key. There is no need to repeat the h key or the v key.

Note if you want multiple speed increase then you have to enter the require pair of keys multiple times:. For example
h p h p h p              3 increases of the horizontal speed
h p h m                   1 increase followed by 1 decrease of the horizontal speed
v m v m v m v m     4 decreases of the vertical speed
h p v p                    1 increase of the horizontal speed and 1 decrease of the vertical speed


## qedL3BB2hpNum1.sb3
Click on Green flag to start and red hex button to stop.
On the keyboard, click on the up-arrow key to adjust the nose of the helicopter. Too many up-arrow clicks
makes the nose of the helicopter point too much upwards and too few makes the nose point too much downwards.
Try to maintain a fine balance between these two extremes. Note the tower is creeping very slowly twoards the
helicopter, but there is nothing you can do about this.


## qedL3BB3snake.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game.

The four keys , up, down, right & left keys when clicked alter the orientation of the head of the snake.
When the snake is moved by the main part of the project the direction of the movement of the snake
is determined by the orientation of the head of the snake. 

As the snake moves it creates a tail/body. The game ends then the snake's head hits the edge of the
Stage panel. For a difficult configuration of the game the game also ends when the head of the snake
hits its own tail/body.

At the start of the main part of the game there are two parameters/variables that you can change:
(a) speed of the movement of the snake
(b) easy or difficult configuration of the game


## qedL3BB4pingPong.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game.
The red bat on the left can be moved up or down by moving the mouse.

## cloneEg1.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game. This project investigates CLONES.
Note that the set of clones are based on the sprite selected when starting this Scratch coding.

The variable appended with Global (xGlobal|) was created using:  For All Sprites. This mesans that for
all sprites in the project, including all of the clones created:
(a) there is just one xGlobal variable
(b) this single Global variable is visible (ie common) to all the sprites/clones in the Scratch project.

The variable appended with Local (xLocal|) was created using:  For This Sprite Only. This means that :
(a) there is a set of  xLocal variables, one for each clone and the 'base' sprite
(b) this set of xLocal variables are only visible in its own clone/sprite.

Pressing the x key on the keyboad displays the values of the xLocal for each clone created.
Pressing the d key on the keyboad deletes each clone created.

# NOTES ABOUT SCRATCH
## PROBLEM: IN SCRATCH CODE PANEL, CODE STACK TRAPPED BEHIND THE CODE BLOCK PALETTE
In the code panel, click on the minus(-) item a few times to reduce the magnification. This may make the trapped code blocks to jut-out from under the palette panel and therefore can be dragged back to the code panel. Drag the top-most block of a stack, otherwise the stack would break-up, giving you another problem to sort out. You can also try clicking the equals(=)

The following are list of items that have some control on the magnification and position of the code blocks in the Scratch code panel.

1. size of the Internet Browser window (reduced or maximum)
2. Internet Browser Zoom (eg 100%) 
3. Scratch stage (where all the action takes place) size (reduced or maximum) (Top, Right)
4. Scratch code panel has three items:    +  -  and =
5. Various vertical scrolls
6. Various horizontal scroll
7. Scratch code panel (Bottom, Centre), you may have to click Backup(etc...) until you get horizontal scroll. This horizontal scroll may be quite important to move the code blocks out from under the palette

## PROBLEM:  TOP OF SCRATCH CODE PANEL, START (green flag) & STOP (red hex button) BUTTONS DISAPPEARS.  ALSO THE SPRITE ICON IS NOT AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE CODE PANEL
Click on another Sprite and then re-click on the sprite that was a problem

or

Refresh the Internet browser, but before doing this it would be a good idea to save the current code


## Variables sometime are not displayed properly
In the Code Block pallette, disable and re-enable the variable that is a problem


## To Delete a Variable in Scratch
1. In your code, edit out all occurances of the variable you want to delete.
2. To do this you might need to first create a new variable that you want to replace the variable you want to delete
2. Click on the category Variables.
3. Right click on the actual variable you want to delete to get a dropdown list of options. An option to delete
the unused variable should be available. 

## To Rename a Variable in Scratch
1. Click on the category Variables
2. Right click on the actual variable you want to rename to get a dropdown list of options
3. An option to rename the variable should be available
4. All occurances of the variable, you want to rename, should be automatically edited in the code by Scratch

## To Rename/Delete a Message used in the broadcast code blocks
I suspect that you cannot directly rename a message. What you can do is create a new message and
edit your code such that the old message is not used. It looks to me that Scratch noticed that there
is an unused message and automatically deletes it.

## Gradient/Fading Color for the Background, in Scratch

1. Scratch > Backdrop > Paint > Costume eg BlueWhite1 > lowest magnification (-) > Outline set to zero width

2. Disable the line/edge/outline box
3. In Fill Box, click on the uniform button (there are 4 buttons at the top of the Fill Box) 
4. Adjust the color ( eg Blue)
5. Click on the button with the required gradient: horizontal, vertical or radial
6. Adjust the  second color ( eg White)
7. Click on Swap if necessary
8. Click on a clear area to dismiss the Fill Box
9. Click on Rectangle and draw a rectangle to cover all of the backdrop/panel/stage

If you want to start anew, click on the selector arrow and select the backdrop. Then click on Delete.




## Fill a Closed Shape Made From Lines For A Sprite, In Scratch

1. Scratch > Sprite > Paint > Sprite Name > x = 0 & y = 0 > Show > Size = 100% > Direction = 90
2. Tab Costume > Costume Name >
3. This should give you a blank Stage panel and a blank Costume panel
4. Adjust Fill Box and the Outline Box to be some paricular colors (same or different)
5. The Fill Box should have the shape fill color and the Outline Box the line color.
Adjust the thickness of the line as well.
6. Click on line and draw a shape, eg a cake/pentagon,
7. Make sure that the first point and the last point are the same location.
8. Click on the Fill icon (pot of paint) and click on the shape.
9. This should give you a shape, filled with the Fill Box color. and surrounded with the line color.
10. Click on the select arrow icon and use it to check/position the shape marker and the centre point marker
of the costume panel...

If you want to start anew, click on the selector arrow and select the shape. Then click on Delete.

NOTE Some shapes may require lines to conincide so as to have the first point and last point to
coincide. For example, an arrow, as shown below. The lines are:  AB, BC, CD, DB and BA where
line AB and BA coincide.
