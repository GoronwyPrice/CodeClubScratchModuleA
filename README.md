# CodeClubScratchModuleA
These file are Scratch .SB3 files, that I produced using Scratch (version 3),  based on the Raspberry Pi Code Club (CC) Module Projects.

To run or use these scratch SB3 files click on each sprite character on the stage (Top, Right) in turn. To see the Scratch code or costumes or sounds, click on each sprite icon below the stage (Bottom, Right), and select the appropriate tab (Top, Left)

For Scratch .SB3 files that have audio, remember to enable audio on your computer so that you can hear the sounds from the stage.
