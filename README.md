# CodeClubScratchModuleA
These file are Scratch .SB3 files, that I produced using Scratch (version 3),  based on the Raspberry Pi Code Club (CC) Module Projects.

To see the Scratch code or costumes or sounds, click on each sprite icon below the stage (Bottom, Right), and select the appropriate tab (Top, Left).

To run or use these scratch SB3 files either: (a) click on each sprite character on the stage (Top, Right) in turn or (b) click on the green flag to start.

The red hex when clicked stops the running of the project.

For Scratch .SB3 files that have audio, remember to enable audio on your computer so that you can hear the sounds from the stage. 

1 DRUMversion2.sb3  (audio)  (click on space key on the keyboad) (click on each character on the stage).

2 myModule1RockBand.sb3 (audio) (click on space key on the keyboad) (click the geeen flag).
