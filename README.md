# CodeClubScratchModuleA
These file are Scratch .SB3 files, that I produced using Scratch (version 3),  based on the Raspberry Pi Code Club (CC) Module Projects.

To see the Scratch code or costumes or sounds, click on each sprite icon below the stage (Bottom, Right), and select the appropriate tab (Top, Left).

To run or use these scratch SB3 files either: (a) click on each sprite character on the stage (Top, Right) in turn or (b) click on the green flag to start.

The red hex when clicked stops the running of the project.

For Scratch .SB3 files that have audio, remember to enable audio on your computer so that you can hear the sounds from the stage. 

1 DRUMversion2.sb3  (audio)  (click on space key on the keyboad) (click on each character on the stage).

2 myModule1RockBand.sb3 (audio) (click on space key on the keyboad) (click the geen flag).

3 myModule1GhostBusters.sb3 (audio) (click the geen flag) (click on each character on the stage).

4 myModule1Chatbot.sb3  (click on the character on the stage).

5 myModule1PaintBox.sb3 (click the geen flag) (click on each character on the stage). (Note: eraser works better with very a large width (eg 40, 80 etc) and writing works better with low widths (eg 3, 10 etc)

6 myModule1PaintBoxRemix.sb3  (same as  myModule1PaintBox.sb3) (keyboard key b=blue)

7 myModule1PaintBox_PickColour.sb3  (click the green flag) (click on each character on the stage). (keyboard keys e = erase all o = orange y=yellow g=green r=red space=black w=white) (Investigate pick_a_colour i.e. when you want the colour in the code to be exactly the same as a colour of an item on the stage. Note sometimes in the Scratch code you want to use and if-else construct to choose if two colours are the same of not the same and execute different code for these two circumstances. Try to change the white in the exising code to the red of the red square on the stage. Click on the white colour in the code to get a colour palett and chick on the colour-picker at the bottom of the pallett. Continue with this exercise.

8 myModule1BoatRaceRemix.sb3 (click the green flag)
