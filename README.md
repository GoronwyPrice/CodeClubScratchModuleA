# CodeClubScratchModuleA
These files are Scratch .SB3 files, that I produced using Scratch (version 3),  based on the Raspberry Pi Code Club (CC) Module Projects. I have also used: 20 Games To Create With Scratch by Max Wainewright (QED Publishing 2016).

# How to load a SB3 Scratch file into a Scratch WebPage (version 3) (Windows 10.1)

First, you must have a copy of the sb3 file on your computer. You can download a SB3 file from my GitHub site as follows:

1. Select the SB3 file in my GitHub site
2. Click on the Download button
3. Select Show in Folder option and the SB3 file should be in the Downloads folder

The scratch procedure is:
1. Internet Browser
2. http://scratch.mit.edu/
3. Create
4. Close Tutorial
5. Sign In
6. File name box is:   Untitled
7. File menu/tab/toolBar and Load from your computer
8. Navigate to your sb3 file and Open
9. scratch.mit.edu says: Replace contents of the current project
10. NB Your current project should be a base/empty Scratch project and unimportant. So click on OK to upload your SB3 file. If your current project is not a base/empty Scratch project and is important then click on Cancel and ensure that the current project has been saved in Scratch and try again, selecting OK this time.
11. File name box is:    has name of your file          This indicates that the SB3 Scratch file has been uploaded.

To see the Scratch code or costumes or sounds, click on each sprite icon below the stage (Bottom, Right), and select the appropriate tab (Top, Left). You can do similarly for the Backdrops; start by clicking Stage button on the Bottom, Right.

To run or use these scratch SB3 files either: (a) click on each sprite character on the stage (Top, Right) in turn or (b) click on the green flag to start.

The red hex when clicked stops the running of the project.

For Scratch .SB3 files that have audio, remember to enable audio on your computer so that you can hear the sounds from the stage.

(keyboard keys e = erase all o = orange y=yellow g=green r=red space=black w=white) (Investigate pick_a_colour i.e. when you want the colour in the code to be exactly the same as a colour of an item on the stage. Note sometimes in the Scratch code you want to use an if-else construct to choose if two colours are the same or not the same and execute different code for these two circumstances. Try to change the white in the exising code to the red of the red square on the stage. Click on the white colour in the code to get a colour palett and click on the colour-picker at the bottom of the pallett. The screen dimms. Move the colour-picker icon carefully to the stage and align the colour-picker icon on the red square in the stage and click. Note, the need of the pick_a_colour arises because, using the above example, the red on the pallete may be slightly different to the red of the square on the stage.
8. myModule1BoatRaceRemix.sb3 (click the green flag) (audio).

Click on Green flag to start and red hex button to stop.

Increased or Decrease the Horizontal or Vertical Speed of the fish sprite character.
On the keyboard, click on the h key or the v key to identify horizontal speed or vertical speed of the fish sprite character.

Then click on p key or m key to select if plus or minus  (increase or decrease)  of the already selected speed. If you mis-type
the p key or m key then just re-type the correct key. There is no need to repeat the h key or the v key.

Note if you want multiple speed increase then you have to enter the require pair of keys multiple times:. For example
h p h p h p              3 increases of the horizontal speed
h p h m                   1 increase followed by 1 decrease of the horizontal speed
v m v m v m v m     4 decreases of the vertical speed
h p v p                    1 increase of the horizontal speed and 1 decrease of the vertical speed


## qedL3BB2hpNum1.sb3
Click on Green flag to start and red hex button to stop.
On the keyboard, click on the up-arrow key to adjust the nose of the helicopter. Too many up-arrow clicks
makes the nose of the helicopter point too much upwards and too few makes the nose point too much downwards.
Try to maintain a fine balance between these two extremes. Note the tower is creeping very slowly twoards the
helicopter, but there is nothing you can do about this.


## qedL3BB3snake.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game.

The four keys , up, down, right & left keys when clicked alter the orientation of the head of the snake.
When the snake is moved by the main part of the project the direction of the movement of the snake
is determined by the orientation of the head of the snake. 

As the snake moves it creates a tail/body. The game ends then the snake's head hits the edge of the
Stage panel. For a difficult configuration of the game the game also ends when the head of the snake
hits its own tail/body.

At the start of the main part of the game there are two parameters/variables that you can change:
(a) speed of the movement of the snake
(b) easy or difficult configuration of the game


## qedL3BB4pingPong.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game.
The red bat on the left can be moved up or down by moving the mouse.

## cloneEg1.sb3
Click on the Green flag to start and red hex button to stop the game. This project investigates CLONES.
Note that the set of clones are based on the sprite selected when starting this Scratch coding.

The variable appended with Global (xGlobal|) was created using:  For All Sprites. This mesans that for
all sprites in the project, including all of the clones created:
(a) there is just one xGlobal variable
(b) this single Global variable is visible (ie common) to all the sprites/clones in the Scratch project.

The variable appended with Local (xLocal|) was created using:  For This Sprite Only. This means that :
(a) there is a set of  xLocal variables, one for each clone and the 'base' sprite
(b) this set of xLocal variables are only visible in its own clone/sprite.

Pressing the x key on the keyboad displays the values of the xLocal for each clone created.
Pressing the d key on the keyboad deletes each clone created.

## module2CreateYourOwnWorld.sb3

To start this game use Green flag and, use the red hex dot to stop the game at any
time during the game.

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the player sprite: up or down and
left or right.

The objective is to get the treasure, located in a chest, and return to the starting
location (left side of room 1).

To learn about this game, use the four arrow keyboard keys to move the player
to touch the other sprites and backdrop objects. Also, after touching an item,
move the player backwards until the player is no longer touching an other item.
Try to touch even the items that move. For some of the objects, touching them
immediately stops the game. You can them click the Green flag to re-start the game.

Some times there are oblong, backdrop objects on the left and/or right of the Stage.
When these object appear, the left object is yellow and on the right object is orange.
If the player touches these objects then a new room is entered and the backdrop
is changed. The orange object (an exit) takes the player forward room-to-room
and the yellow object (an exit) takes the player backward room-to-roon. Note that
this is a simplified description of the effect of touching the yellow and orange objects.
Note the yellow object is sometimes an entrance for the player esprite.

Enable or disable the variables:  room and coin

Enable or disable the list:  inventory

To out-smart the red, enemy sprite move the player behind the enemy and
at the correct moment use the down or up arrow to move the player out
of the path of the returning enemy.

In room 3 the chest sprite appears, but the blue-door bars the player to get to the chest.
Also present is a blue key sprite. Touching the blue key should result in opening the
door-blue and in the blue key being added to the inventory.

There is a flaw in my Scratch code when the game is in room 3. At this point the door-blue
sprite should be visible and the blue key sprite should be visible. Sometime this is
not so. I suspect that there is a 'race' problem somewhere in my Scratch code. You can
now investigate this flaw or click on the red hex dot to stop the game and then re-start
the game.

If the flaw does not occur, touching the chest should result in getting the treasure.
Then retrace the player's path; but once the player is through the open gate the
getTreasureI appears in the inventory. Also, at this point the gate is automatically closed !!!
Then retrace the player's path back to left side of room 1.

## module3CATS_BBB.sb3

To start this game use Green flag and, use the red hex dot to stop the game at any
time during the game.

After starting the game (click the Green flag) the following two major things happen.
Firstly, by moving and clicking the mouse pointer, a line can be traced on the stage. 
This facility can be used to draw a line across the gap in the platform on the Stage.
Secondly, clones of the cat sprite are continuously generated.

If the gap has not been repaired with a line, the cat clones fall into the pit and are deleted
when they touch the edge at the bottom of the pit. Experiment with repair
lines at different levels in the pit, incomplete lines, lines across the pit
but extending out of the pit, line with curves,  lines not touching the edges of the gap,
rugged lines etc.

Notice, that the clones when they touch a line climb up to the top of the platform
on the Stage. Then the clones walk along the top of the platform.

In the top, right corner of the Stage the stationary cat is the orginal cat sprite. The
clones are copies of this orginal cat sprite. You could modify the code so as to hide
this cat and/or relocate it on the Stage.

When the clones get near the left edge, they safely exit the Stage through
the door (i.e. they are deleted if they touch the door). Also the project counts the
clones that touch the door (variable scoreG). The variable noOfCATclones
counts the number of clones produced. At the end of the game (click the red dot or
press the space key on the keyboard) and check if these two variables are equal etc.
Try to explain whatever result you got (looking at the code might help you).

If the space key on the keyboard is pessed then the generating of the
cat clones is stopped, and the project waits until all the cat clone have
been done. Clicking the hex dot stops the code abruptly.

# SB3 File
## module3FlowerGeneratorAAA.sb3

To start click the Green Flag and to stop click the red hex dot at anytime during the execution of the project. You can also let the project to go to completion.

To erase the stamp flowers/Stop press the e key on the keyboard. Note that this facility is not essential as the project erases all the previous stamp flowers and stamp Stop before it generates the new stamp flowers and stamp Stop.

The items in the top right corner of the stage are the original sprites. During the creating of the stamp flowers and stamp Stop the original sprites are hidden so that you can see only the operations of the stamp flowers and stamp Stop.

Note that you can hide or show the sprite icons and you can move them to a dfferent location on the Stage. The stamp petal/Stop are fixed in their original point on the
Stage, they can be erased or not erased and they are always visible. Further when you use the pen code block erase it will ease the all the stamp generated by all sprites, petal and Stop in this project.

## module3FlowerGeneratorBBB.sb3

Click green flag to start and red hex dot to stop at any time during the execution
of the projrct.

Click on the sprite Petal and the the following key on the keyboard in turn:
1. d	diagonal row of flowers
2. m	multiple flowers i.e. one sprite on top of another sprite
3. r	random position of flowers
4. p	pattern, matrix of flowers
5. s	spectrum of flower colors
6. e	erase previous flowers

Click on the sprite Oblong and the the following key on the keyboard in turn:
1. f	fire works flowers

# SB3

## module3FlowerGeneratorCCC.sb3

Click green flag to start and red hex dot to stop at any time during the execution
of the project.

Click on the sprite Petal and the following key on the keyboard:
s	spectrum of flower colors (ROYGBIV)
e	erase previous flowers


# SB3

## Module3GuessTheFlagBBB.sb3

Click on the Green Flag to Start the project and click on the red hex dot to stop the project at any point during the execution of the project.

Another way to stop the project and a less drastic way is, first get to the place where the set of flags are displayed and the quizz-master has asked the player to click a flag for a particular country. To stop the project, rather than click a flag, press the space key on the keyboard.

The number of flags in the set of flags for the player to choose from is set by the variable: noOfFlagsToChooseFromL. This variable can be edited and it is located in the block script 'when green flag clicked'. The value of this variable should be in the range 1 to 8. Modiy the code to not allow this variable to be not outside this range.


Note: The character L or G appended on the end of the variables mean:
1. L - local i.e. visible (scope) only for a particular esprite and
2. G - global i.e. visible for all the esprites in the project

The number of successes achieved by the player is stored in the  varable called:  scoreG.



Have a look at the following code that gives too much help to the game player.
Modify the code so that the game player does not get this help.

'when this sprite clicked' for the Flag sprite then:
CostumeNameG and CostumeNumberG,  as in Flag list,  are displayed.
This helps to check if the code is working,  but it also helps the game player.

The following variables, that are for ChosenFlags list  is enabled:
CorrectAnswerG
This helps to check if the code is working,  but it also helps the game player.

## DisplayTextClonesAAA.sb3

Click on the Green flag to start this project, and click on the red hex dot to stop it at any time during its execution .

The My Blocks called DisplayText uses the input parameter called text to get the actual text to be displayed. The actual text is set to the variable textL.
and can be edited to any digit value by the user of the project.

The input parameter called characterWidth is set in the variable characterWidthL that can be edited. It governs the separation between the characters/digits
in the text when displayed.

The input parameter called align is used in DisplayText to align the text with the left-most or right-most character in the input text. This alignment can be
demonstrated by displaying two or more texts on diferent rows,  above/below each other. If the alignment is set to RIGHT then the texts (numbers) are aligned
with the units for each text/number in the same vertical column. If the LEFT alignment is used then the numbers are aligned similar to to a postal address.
The alignment variable is called alignL and can be edited to either LEFT or RIGHT.

Note: Variables are appended with either L, G or B
1. L = local i.e. they are visible in the sprite only
2. G = global i.e. they are visible across all the sprites
3. B = block i.e. they are like local but used only in a My Block

Before each call to DisplayText there are two code blocks: set textL that has
the text number to be displayed and go to x y code block used to locate
the row (y-coordinate) and column (x-coordinate) for the text number

# NOTES ABOUT SCRATCH
## PROBLEM: IN SCRATCH CODE PANEL, CODE STACK TRAPPED BEHIND THE CODE BLOCK PALETTE
In the code panel, click on the minus(-) item a few times to reduce the magnification. This may make the trapped code blocks to jut-out from under the palette panel and therefore can be dragged back to the code panel. Drag the top-most block of a stack, otherwise the stack would break-up, giving you another problem to sort out. You can also try clicking the equals(=)

The following are list of items that have some control on the magnification and position of the code blocks in the Scratch code panel.

1. size of the Internet Browser window (reduced or maximum)
2. Internet Browser Zoom (eg 100%) 
3. Scratch stage (where all the action takes place) size (reduced or maximum) (Top, Right)
4. Scratch code panel has three items:    +  -  and =
5. Various vertical scrolls
6. Various horizontal scroll
7. Scratch code panel (Bottom, Centre), you may have to click Backup(etc...) until you get horizontal scroll. This horizontal scroll may be quite important to move the code blocks out from under the palette

## PROBLEM:  TOP OF SCRATCH CODE PANEL, START (green flag) & STOP (red hex button) BUTTONS DISAPPEARS.  ALSO THE SPRITE ICON IS NOT AT THE TOP RIGHT OF THE CODE PANEL
Click on another Sprite and then re-click on the sprite that was a problem

or

Refresh the Internet browser, but before doing this it would be a good idea to save the current code


## Variables sometime are not displayed properly
In the Code Block pallette, disable and re-enable the variable that is a problem


## To Delete a Variable in Scratch
1. In your code, edit out all occurances of the variable you want to delete.
2. To do this you might need to first create a new variable that you want to replace the variable you want to delete
2. Click on the category Variables.
3. Right click on the actual variable you want to delete to get a dropdown list of options. An option to delete
the unused variable should be available. 

## To Rename a Variable in Scratch
1. Click on the category Variables
2. Right click on the actual variable you want to rename to get a dropdown list of options
3. An option to rename the variable should be available
4. All occurances of the variable, you want to rename, should be automatically edited in the code by Scratch

## To Rename/Delete a Message used in the broadcast code blocks
I suspect that you cannot directly rename a message. What you can do is create a new message and
edit your code such that the old message is not used. It looks to me that Scratch noticed that there
is an unused message and automatically deletes it.
